            // It is important for you to understand that the order in which you place your code is a very critical factor in how
            // it will be utilized or viewed within the console. for example:

            //Console.WriteLine();
            // Console.WriteLine("Here is a 'Right Triangle' Shape I made using C#!");
            // Console.WriteLine("   /|");

            // Console.WriteLine("/___|");
            // Console.WriteLine(" /  |");

            // Particularly C# is primarily a set of instructions that are placed in a particular order.
            // Though you will eventually find that parts of the code for C# will become more complex as time goes on from
            // the basics to more complex commands and sets of instructions.
